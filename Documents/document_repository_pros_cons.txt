    CONS​:

        -RPA bot update files in Peoplesoft that may cause pay related issues​

        -UI Limitations: AWS Console is functional but not optimized for non-technical users or document-centric workflows.​

        -Requiring business users to FTP/SFTP the input file into the bucket​
        -Developing a bot task in AA to sweep file from a Box folder into the bucket.
